# SOLID Principles in .NET

One of the most common acronyms you will come across as a .NET developer is **SOLID**.  
SOLID represents five fundamental object-oriented design principles that help make software more maintainable, scalable, and flexible.

## SOLID stands for:

- **S** – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O** – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L** – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I** – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D** – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The **Single Responsibility Principle** states that a class should have **only one reason to change**.This means a class should have only one job or responsibility.
